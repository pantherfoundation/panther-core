# Repository Docs

This repository contains the documentation for the project as a mixture of markdown pages and `puml` diagrams.

In order to understand Panther Protocol's architecture in full, the following approach is recommended by the internal team.

Your complete understanding of the materials presented here should yield:

- An intuitive understanding of the problem Panther Protocol is solving
- A high level understanding of the architecture of Panther Protocol
- A detailed understanding of the components, interactions and processes of Panther Protocol
- A comprehensive understanding of the functionalities available through Panther Protocol
- An understanding of governance, community run aspects and day to day functionality of Panther Protocol

## Recommended Approach

1. Read through the [Whitepaper](https://pantherprotocol.io/whitepaper) to understand the high-level architecture and the problem Panther Protocol is solving for.

2. Thereafter, head to [the overview](overview) in this directory. After reading the ðŸš§ abstract and ðŸš§ introduction presented there, you should have a high level understanding of the whats, the whys and the hows of Panther Protocol from an entirely non technical perspective.

<!-- abstract and introduction are proposed entry points, still wip -->

3. Understanding the technical architecture of Panther Protocol requires a grasp of the concepts of key technologies and engineering processes which are utilised in bring Panther's vision to reality. These are explained in detail in [the basics](overview/basics.md).

<!-- basics, still wip -->

_Note that each category separates high and low level documentations for the concept. If you are a layman, looking to understand the general processes used, the high level documents will suffice. If you are a developer, architect or enthusiast, you will find the low level documentation delivers a succinct and near complete image of the protocol and it's technical functionalities._

4. Once you have a good understanding of the basics, you can move on to [the core](core.md). This section will provide you with a detailed understanding of the Panther Protocol's architecture, the components, the interactions and the processes. Your understanding of this should be near innate given your comprehension of the materials contained in the previous sections.

5. With a comphrehensive understanding of the utility provided by the dApp and the Protocol, we can now inspect the functionalities available through the exhibition of these technologies seen under [special abilities](special-abilities). These are some of the features which make Panther unique as a product, aligning with the requirements of a global financial market and presenting a subsequential bridge between what has become decentralised finance between the past (2009-current date) and the future.

6. As with any truly decentralised system, the day to day functionality and governance should be managed by a decentralised community. The manner in which this aim manifests within Panther Protocol is detailed under [community](community).

<!-- community, still wip -->

7. [WIP](wip) @dev. A subsequential part of the development cycle is in draft, hence so to are docs and diagrams for the Protocol. This folder should be empty and removed once the documentation is signed off and relocated.

## Nota Bene

Add notes here relating to continuous development of the documentation.
